For our final project in Web Systems and Technologies, our team developed a dynamic web application using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN UI. This project served as a practical application of our skills in frontend development, API integration, and data visualization. We utilized the JSONPlaceholder API to fetch and display users, posts, and comments, while interactive user profiles were enhanced with Mapbox for location mapping. To visualize application data in real-time, we integrated ApexCharts. The development process involved planning, building, styling, and deploying a responsive and modern web interface. We began by setting up a fresh Next.js project with the App Router and configured Tailwind CSS for styling. ShadCN UI components were added for consistent UI elements such as buttons, cards, pagination, charts, and sidebars. For efficient data fetching, we used React Query, and Google Maps functionality was included using the @react-google-maps/api package. The application was run locally using npm run dev and built for production with npm run build followed by npm start. Team responsibilities were divided as follows: Shannel L. Regala initiated the project and handled page functionality, Davilyn E. Genetia designed the UI using Tailwind CSS, Jasmine Mary P. Ginete implemented user authentication features, and Evelyn E. Bangate managed the deployment and ensured the websiteâ€™s functionality. The completed application was deployed via Vercel and is accessible at https://viewpoint-sage.vercel.app/.
